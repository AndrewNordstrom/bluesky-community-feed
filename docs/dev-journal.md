# Dev Journal

## 2026-03-06 — Phase 1: Cleanup & Polish

- Removed unused `bullmq` and `@fastify/jwt` dependencies (confirmed zero imports in src/)
- Fixed web/package.json name, index.html title, replaced Vite README boilerplate
- Stripped Vite template remnants from web/src/App.css
- Enhanced polis.ts JSDoc with `@status` and `@planned` tags; fixed `process.env` → `config` access
- Added `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm run test`, and web build to CI deploy workflow
- Created `src/db/queries/` with subscriber upsert and epoch lookup extractions as reuse pattern
- All 162 tests pass, backend and frontend builds clean

## 2026-03-06 — Phase 2: acceptsInteractions Support

- Added `acceptsInteractions: true` to feed publication record in `scripts/publish-feed.ts`
- Created migration 015 for `feed_interactions` table with indexes on time, user, post, and epoch
- Implemented `POST /xrpc/app.bsky.feed.sendInteractions` endpoint with mandatory JWT auth, Zod validation (max 100 items), batch parameterized INSERT, and `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
- Registered route in server.ts after `registerFeedSkeleton`
- Added configurable rate limiting (60 req/min default via `RATE_LIMIT_INTERACTIONS_MAX/WINDOW_MS`)
- Added `GET /api/admin/interactions/feed-signals` analytics endpoint: totals by type (today/yesterday/7-day), per-epoch breakdown, top posts by requestMore/requestLess ratio
- All 162 tests pass, build clean

## 2026-03-06 — Phase 3: Scoring Component Interface

- Defined `ScoringComponent` interface and `ScoringContext` in `src/scoring/component.interface.ts`
- Added `ScoringComponent` wrappers to all 5 components (recency, engagement, bridging, source-diversity, relevance) alongside existing functions — zero breaking changes
- Created `src/scoring/registry.ts` with `DEFAULT_COMPONENTS` array and `validateRegistry()` that cross-checks against votable-params at module load
- Refactored `scorePost()` in pipeline.ts to iterate `DEFAULT_COMPONENTS` with type-safe `WEIGHT_ACCESSORS` lookup map (no `as any`)
- `scoreAllPosts()` now creates `ScoringContext` once per run with fresh `authorCounts`
- `storeScore()` unchanged — Golden Rule preserved
- All 162 tests pass, build clean

## 2026-03-06 — Phase 4: Private Feed Access Gating

- Created migration 016 for `approved_participants` table with soft delete (`removed_at`) and partial index on active DIDs
- Added `FEED_PRIVATE_MODE` config toggle (default false) to Zod config schema
- Created `src/feed/access-control.ts` with Redis-cached `isParticipantApproved()` (300s TTL) and `invalidateParticipantCache()`
- Gated feed access in `feed-skeleton.ts`: returns empty `{ feed: [] }` for unapproved users when private mode active
- Gated governance voting in `vote.ts`: throws `Errors.FORBIDDEN()` for unapproved participants
- Added admin participant management routes (GET/POST/DELETE `/api/admin/participants`) with Bluesky handle resolution via `@atproto/api`, audit logging, and Redis cache invalidation
- Exposed `feedPrivateMode` in admin status response for frontend conditional rendering
- Created `ParticipantsPanel` component with add-by-DID-or-handle form, participant table, and remove confirmation
- Participants tab conditionally visible in admin dashboard only when private mode is active
- All 162 tests pass, backend and frontend builds clean
