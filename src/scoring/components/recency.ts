/**
 * Recency Scoring Component
 *
 * Scores posts based on how recently they were created.
 * Uses exponential decay with half-life at 1/4 of the scoring window.
 *
 * Formula: e^(-λ × age) where λ = ln(2) / halfLife
 *
 * Examples (for 72-hour window, 18-hour half-life):
 * - 0 hours old: 1.0
 * - 18 hours old: 0.5
 * - 36 hours old: 0.25
 * - 72 hours old: 0.0625
