 * 1. MVP: Return 0.5 for all posts (implemented here)
 * 2. V2: Keyword/topic matching based on subscriber interests
 * 3. V3: Sentence transformer embeddings + cosine similarity
 * 4. V4: Fine-tuned classifier
 *
 * The interface is designed to support future implementations that take
 * post content and subscriber context into account.
