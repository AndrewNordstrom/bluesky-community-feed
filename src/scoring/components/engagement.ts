/**
 * Engagement Scoring Component
 *
 * Scores posts based on engagement (likes, reposts, replies).
 * Uses logarithmic scaling for diminishing returns - viral posts don't completely dominate.
 *
 * Weights:
 * - Likes: 1.0
 * - Reposts: 2.0
 * - Replies: 3.0
 *
 * Formula: log10(rawEngagement + 1) / log10(1001)
 * This normalizes to 0.0-1.0 range where 1000 engagement ≈ 1.0
 *
 * Examples:
 * - 0 engagement: 0.0
 * - 1 engagement: ~0.10
 * - 10 engagement: ~0.35
 * - 100 engagement: ~0.67
 * - 1000 engagement: 1.0
