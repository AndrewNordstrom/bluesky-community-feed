/**
 * Bridging Scoring Component
 *
 * Measures cross-cluster appeal - does this post attract engagement
 * from users in different social "bubbles"?
 *
 * MVP Implementation: Jaccard distance of engager follow sets.
 * - Get users who liked/reposted the post
 * - Compare their follow sets pairwise
 * - Low overlap = high bridging (they come from different "worlds")
 *
 * Upgrade path:
 * 1. MVP: Follower overlap of engagers (implemented here)
 * 2. V2: Pre-cluster subscribers, check which clusters engaged
 * 3. V3: Matrix factorization (Community Notes approach)
 *
 * This is designed to be pluggable - swap the implementation later.
